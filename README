CONTROLS

mlbviewer is hot key driven much like mplayer.  A later release will likely 
include an on-screen menu.

HOTKEYS

h                   Display version and keybindings
Up/Down             Highlight games in the current view
Enter               Play video of highlighted game
a                   Play Gameday audio of highlighted game
c                   Play Condensed Game Video (if available)
t                   Display top plays listing for current game
Left/Right          Navigate one day forward or back
j                   Jump to a date
p                   Toggle speed (does not change config file)
r                   Refresh listings
d                   Toggle debug (does not change config file)
q                   Quit mlbviewer

CONFIGURATION FILE SETTINGS

The options in the config file ~/.mlb/config are

user = x (mandatory) 

pass = x (mandatory)

NOTE: Top Plays don't require a login, but these parameters are still mandatory.
You can include them as user= and pass= without values if you don't have an 
mlb.com account and only intend to use Top Plays feature.

speed =x (speed for streaming video, 800 or 400)

video_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

top_plays_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

(Optional, defaults to video_player setting, but you might want to set a 
smaller cache size since these tend to be short streams anyway)

audio_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

blackout = x (local team that you can't watch)
blackout = y (another, but at least you live in a happening place)

show_player_command = True/False (displays the command line the program uses to
play the video)

debug = True/False (informative errors to figure out what's going wrong)

x_display = x (use this to set your DISPLAY variable, useful for remote launch)

audio_follow = x (team whose local radio broadcasters you always want
to listen to)

Note that blackout and audio_follow use the following team codes:
     'ana', 'ari', 'atl', 'bal', 'bos', 'chc', 'cin', 'cle', 'col',
     'cws', 'det', 'fla', 'hou', 'kc', 'la', 'mil', 'min', 'nym',
     'nyy', 'oak', 'phi', 'pit', 'sd', 'sea', 'sf', 'stl', 'tb',
     'tex', 'tor', 'was'


A WORD ON DEBUGGING

By default, basic status messages are written to the log file in ~/.mlb/log.

mlbviewer is written with stability in mind.  Sometimes this stability hides 
errors that might be useful for the development team to figure out what's really
going on.  The debug state is not meant for normal operation.  In fact, with
debugging enabled, the audio or video URL will be retrieved, but the player 
process won't be started.  Debugging also disables most of the exception 
handling code.  In other words, debugging allows errors to drop through like a 
lead ball and produce Tracebacks.  Finally, debugging also produces verbose
network logging in the log file by dumping the raw web page and cookie content.
Please use debugging only if you suspect mlbviewer is covering up an error.

MLBGAMEID TEST TOOL

Every stream (audio or video including top plays) has a stream ID, a six digit
number, associated with it.  Every request to play a stream will output that 
six digit stream ID to the log file (regardless of the debug setting.)  If 
you want to test stream retrieval outside of mlbviewer (e.g. the error flies 
by the screen too quickly before returning to the listings screen), you can use
the mlbgameid.py script included in the test directory.  To use it, just call
that script with the stream ID as the argument.  To find a stream ID for a 
particular stream, select it first in mlbviewer (Enter or 'a') and then 
check the log file for a line like this:

Querying enterworkflow.do for { 'gameid' : 2008/04/30/kcamlb-texmlb-1, 'streamid' : 661986, 'streamtype' : video}

The stream ID for this video is 661986.  You can then call mlbgameid like this:

python test/mlbgameid.py 661986

mlbgameid will produce a lot of output very much like debugging except it will 
also execute your player command as specified in your configuration file.  The 
output of mlbgameid is NOT written to the log file.

ADDITIONAL HELP

mlbviewer was born out of discussion in a forum on LinuxQuestions.org.  Some
very valuable discussions, concerns, feature requests, and most importantly 
bug reports were shared in this forum to make mlbviewer the robust and 
fairly stable application that it is today.  If you have any questions, 
concerns, feature requests, or bug reports, you can post to this thread:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/fedora-35/mlb.tv-in-linux-432479/

You can also find lots of tips and tricks in there and some very helpful users
who have probably encountered any issues you might have with mlbviewer or 
supporting applications.

If you want to lavish praise on us, we'll be happy to receive it there too.

Tips and tricks (or the very least links to the original forum posts) will 
also be summarized on a mini-HOWTO page at:

SVN

mlbviewer has an svn repository on sourceforge.  You can checkout the latest
development code at any time with the following command:

svn co https://mlbviewer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlbviewer/trunk mlbviewer

You will need to install the subversion package if you don't have the svn 
command.  

Svn revisions are not official releases but they have the most recent bug
fixes and new features being tested.  It is through the efforts of those 
who want to test svn code that the development team gains confidence in 
any new code.  Please post any comments about svn revisions to the Linux
Questions forum above.  

When reporting bugs, please state the svn revision you are using.  This can be 
found with the 'svn info' command:

matthew@tango:~/mlbtv/svn/mlbviewer$ svn info
Path: .
URL: https://mlbviewer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlbviewer/trunk
Repository Root: https://mlbviewer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlbviewer
