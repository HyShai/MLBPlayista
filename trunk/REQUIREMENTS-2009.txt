REQUIREMENTS FOR MLBVIEWER 2009 SEASON

Quite a bit has changed between last season and next.  While every attempt has
been made to minimize changes to the requirements and the features supported 
last year, some things are just out of my control.

To get going for the 2009 season, you will need the following packages:

OPTIONAL (but very helpful, especially for Linux beginners!):

Setuptools - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

This will help you download and install the required python packages

REQUIRED:

PyXML - http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/download.html

suds - https://fedorahosted.org/suds/

Simplejson - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

setuptools users: You can install these with the following commands (as root):

$ easy_install pyxml
$ easy_install suds
$ easy_install simplejson

Please read on for further requirements depending on whether you are an MLB.TV
Premium or MLB.TV Basic subscriber.

PREMIUM USERS

You will need the autobahn.jar file from the NexDef plugin.  You can find that
file here:

http://mlb.com/nexdef-jars/

To run the NexDef plugin:

$ java -jar autobahn.jar

NON-PREMIUM USERS (and Gameday Audio subscribers)

You will need rtmpdump version 1.5.

rtmpdump - http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtmpdump/

You will need version 1.5 of rtmpdump.  You will also need to patch version 1.5
using the Patch.sh script in the rtmpdump-patches directory.

You can find version 1.5 at this URL:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=248826&package_id=303903

The patch is not tested with version 1.5a or later.  It might work with version
1.5a but it probably won't work with any later versions.

ALL USERS - VERY IMPORTANT

You will need to re-compile MPlayer from source.  MPlayer requires a bug fix
to play MLB.TV streams smoothly.  This fix is only a couple of weeks old and 
far too new for any distribution's version of MPlayer to have it.

QUICK INSTRUCTIONS FOR GETTING AND BUILDING THE LATEST MPLAYER

Step 1: Verify you have subversion by typing "svn":

$ svn
Type 'svn help' for usage.
$

If you don't have subversion, you can download it from your distribution's
package management system (e.g. apt-get install subversion if you're using 
Ubuntu or Debian), or you can get it here:

http://subversion.tigris.org/

Step 2: Download the latest MPlayer source via svn:

$ svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk mplayer

Step 3: Run the configure script with, at a minimum, the following options:

$ cd mplayer
$ sh configure --enable-dynamic-plugins --prefix=/usr

It's very important you use --prefix=/usr as you want to install this new 
version of mplayer over your pre-distributed package.

Step 4: Run 'make'

$ make

Step 5: (as root), run 'make install'

$ make install


ALL USERS - EQUALLY IMPORTANT :-)

In order to make media requests, mlbviewer must use the SOAP protocol (the 
suds package required above.)  HOWEVER, mlb.com's description files are 
not entirely valid.  To make valid requests, it is necessary to use our
own description files.  It's not necessary to understand this except that you
will need to copy the two MediaService files to your .mlb directory:

$ mkdir -p ~/.mlb 

(This is not necessary if you already have a ~/.mlb directory from last year.)

$ cp MediaService.* ~/.mlb/

READ THE README FOR MORE HELP ON USING MLBVIEWER 2009.

Also, you can post any support questions either to the Sourceforge forum at:

https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=224512

Or the Linux Questions thread here:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/fedora-35/mlb.tv-in-linux-432479/

No, you don't have to read all 100+ pages.  Just skip to the last page
and post question to the end of the thread.  There are several helpful
testers who have been with this project since the start.
