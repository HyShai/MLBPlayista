Additional Configuration Options:

You may also need to modify the following options to your preferences.  The
defaults are listed here:

# The %s and %f flags will be substituted with the stream url and recorded
# filenames, respectively.
video_recorder=mplayer -dumpfile %f -dumpstream %s
audio_recorder=mplayer -dumpfile %f -dumpstream -playlist %s

# The number of seconds the player should lag behind the recorder to ensure
# the player buffer doesn't read beyond the recorded stream.
dvr_delay=60

# The command-line option for the player process to resume playback at a given
# seconds offset.  If the player process should stop, it will be restarted
# with this option to join playback at (elapsed - dvr_delay) seconds.
# Hint: mplayer uses -ss and vlc uses --seconds
dvr_resume=-ss

# Default operation of mlbdvr is to start a recorder process and after dvr_delay
# start the player process.  If you wish to record the game for viewing later,
# you can set this option to True.
dvr_record_only=False

# The location to store saved games.
# Use absolute paths only.
dvr_record_dir=$HOME/mlbdvr_games
