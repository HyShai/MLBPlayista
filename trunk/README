This is a short and to the point readme. It will be longer and say
more in the future. Watch baseball games by pressing return. Listen to
them by pressing a. Up goes up, down goes down.

The options in the config file ~/.mlb/config are

user = x (mandatory) 

pass = x (mandatory)

NOTE: Top Plays don't require a login, but these parameters are still mandatory.
You can include them as user= and pass= without values if you don't have an 
mlb.com account and only intend to use Top Plays feature.

speed =x (speed for streaming video, 800 or 400)

video_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

top_plays_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

(Optional, defaults to video_player setting, but you might want to set a 
smaller cache size since these tend to be short streams anyway)

audio_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

blackout = x (local team that you can't watch)
blackout = y (another, but at least you live in a happening place)

show_player_command = True/False (displays the command line the program uses to
play the video)

debug = True/False (informative errors to figure out what's going wrong)

x_display = x (use this to set your DISPLAY variable, useful for remote launch)

audio_follow = x (team whose local radio broadcasters you always want
to listen to)

Note that blackout and audio_follow use the following team codes:
     'ana', 'ari', 'atl', 'bal', 'bos', 'chc', 'cin', 'cle', 'col',
     'cws', 'det', 'fla', 'hou', 'kc', 'la', 'mil', 'min', 'nym',
     'nyy', 'oak', 'phi', 'pit', 'sd', 'sea', 'sf', 'stl', 'tb',
     'tex', 'tor', 'was'
