VERY IMPORTANT - WHAT DOESN'T WORK YET

Non-premium subcribers will not be able to watch Live games yet.  There
is an open issue with Mplayer support of the live streams.  There are two
options for watching live games if you are a non-premium subscriber.

OPTION 1: Flash plugin hotkey

Use the 'f' key to open the highlighted game in the Flash player.

OPTION 2: Applian FLV Player (using Wine)

Applian FLV Player works halfway decently on Linux using wine.  Using wine
and setting up FLV Player is beyond the scope of this document.  However,
assuming you have both working, you can use mlblistings.py to locate 
the event id (a number like 14-234455-2009-05-01) and the soapevent.py 
script in the test directory.

$ test/soapevent.py 14-234455-2009-05-01

And open the file in progress with FLV Player:

wine "C:\Program Files\FLV Player\FLVPlayer.exe" 14-234455-2009-05-01.mp4

You will likely not get full-screen performance out of this, but it should be
good enough to watch until the Mplayer fix is available.


Archived video, live and archived audio, and NexDef live and archived 
should work with the latest svn source of Mplayer (see the 
REQUIREMENTS-2009.txt) file for more details.  Rtmpdump requires a patch
(included in rtmpdump-patches directory) for live audio streams.


NEW FOR 2009 SEASON

In 2008, the speed selection was all that differed between premium and 
non-premium users.  In 2009, Premium users have a lot more functionality 
provided by the NexDef plugin.  See the REQUIREMENTS-2009.txt for getting
the NexDef plugin for Linux (also called autobahn.jar interchangeably in
mlbviewer documentation.)

Most of the new features of mlbviewer 2009 are for NexDef users.  If you are 
not a NexDef user/Premium subscriber, you should add "use_nexdef=False" to
your configuration file.  See below for more details on the configuration file.

NexDef users should read the NexDef section below to learn about how to use
the new features.

CONTROLS

mlbviewer is hot key driven much like mplayer.  A later release will likely 
include an on-screen menu.

If you are a returning user from 2008, the new Hotkeys are:

'f' (use flash player for highlighted game)
'n' (toggle between nexdef and rtmpdump mode)
's' (toggle between home and away streams)
'z' (show the listings debug screen)

HOTKEYS

a                   Play Gameday audio of highlighted game
c                   Play Condensed Game Video (if available)
b                   View bookmarks
d                   Toggle debug (does not change config file)
f                   Launch the game in the Flash player
h                   Display version and keybindings
j                   Jump to a date
m                   Bookmark a game
n                   Toggle between NexDef and Basic modes
Left/Right          Navigate one day forward or back
Up/Down             Highlight games in the current view
q                   Quit mlbviewer
p                   Toggle speed (does not change config file)
r                   Refresh listings
s                   Toggle between HOME and AWAY streams
t                   Display top plays listing for current game
Enter               Play video of highlighted game
x (or Bksp)         Delete a bookmark
z                   Helpful debug screen for viewing listings data

CONFIGURATION FILE SETTINGS

New settings for 2009

If you are a returning user from 2008, the following settings are new:

use_nexdef=True/False (Default: True)

live_from_start=True/False (Default: False)

max_bps=x (Default: 800000 or 800K)

flash_browser=x (Default: firefox %s &)

video_follow=x (No default)

See below for more details on these options.

The options in the config file ~/.mlb/config are

user = x (mandatory) 

pass = x (mandatory)

NOTE: Top Plays don't require a login, but these parameters are still mandatory.
You can include them as user= and pass= without values if you don't have an 
mlb.com account and only intend to use Top Plays feature.

speed =x (speed for streaming video, 800 or 400)

video_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

top_plays_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

(Optional, defaults to video_player setting, but you might want to set a 
smaller cache size since these tend to be short streams anyway)

audio_player = x (use %s for url, otherwise it will come at the end)

IMPORTANT: 2008 and prior required -playlist for mplayer and audio streams.  
2009 will not work with -playlist.

blackout = x (local team that you can't watch)
blackout = y (another, but at least you live in a happening place)

show_player_command = True/False (displays the command line the program uses to
play the video)

debug = True/False (informative errors to figure out what's going wrong)

x_display = x (use this to set your DISPLAY variable, useful for remote launch)

audio_follow = x (team whose local radio broadcasters you always want
to listen to)

video_follow = x (same as audio follow except for video)

Note that blackout and audio_follow use the following team codes:
     'ana', 'ari', 'atl', 'bal', 'bos', 'chc', 'cin', 'cle', 'col',
     'cws', 'det', 'fla', 'hou', 'kc', 'la', 'mil', 'min', 'nym',
     'nyy', 'oak', 'phi', 'pit', 'sd', 'sea', 'sf', 'stl', 'tb',
     'tex', 'tor', 'was'

favorite = x (team to highlight in listings using codes above, specify
multiple favorite= lines if you have more than one favorite team you'd like
to highlight)

use_nexdef = True/False (default is True, set this to False if you are not a
Premium user.  This can also be changed with the 'n' key.)

flash_browser = x ( browser command to launch the Flash player if you have
problems with the rtmpdump or nexdef streams )

max_bps = x ( Default: 800000 for an 800K stream.  For Premium users only, 
setting this value to 3000000 - or 3 million - means you prefer to receive 
the highest quality 3000K HD stream.  Setting it to lower values means you 
prefer a quality up to, but not over this setting.  The quality bars in the 
Flash player roughly equate to:

164
400
600
800
1200
1500
2200
3000

Pick a quality above you believe your computer can handle and add three zeroes
to arrive at the max_bps value.  Please read more on the NexDef operation
after this section.)

use_color = True/False (if this is set, either default colors, currently cyan
on black, or colors of your choosing will highlight teams specified in favorite;
if set to false or absent from config, favorite highlighting defaults to 
underlining)

live_from_start = True/False (Default: False, For Premium users, you have
the ability to start a live game from the beginning even while the game 
is currently in progress.  Setting this to True will start the stream 
playback from the Top of the 1st.)

favorite_color = x (the foreground color for favorite highlighting)

Valid color choices are:
    'black', 'white', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan'

If an invalid color is specified, color is disabled and favorite highlighting
defaults to underlining.

If favorite is configured, use_color, and favorite_color are optional and 
will highlighting defaults to underline.  If use_color is set to True, 
favorite_color is optional, and highlighting will default to cyan.  

NEXDEF USERS

First, you'll need the NexDef plugin.  See the REQUIREMENTS-2009.txt file
for acquiring and running the NexDef plugin.

To run the NexDef plugin:

$ java -jar autobahn.jar 

You may or may not want to run this at startup or run it as a service.  
Mlbviewer does not automatically detect whether you have autobahn.jar running.

New to 2009 for Premium subscribers are the following features and if/how
mlbviewer implements them:

+ HD Quality Picture (Yes)

Set your max_bps to 3000000 (3 million) in your configuration file to indicate
a preference for the HD stream:

max_bps=3000000

At this time, this is only a preference setting.  Mlbviewer does not turn 
off auto-adjust quality so you may still get a lower quality stream depending
on network conditions and HD availability.  You may also receive a lower quality
stream but NexDef up-shifts you to the HD stream automatically.  Mlbviewer
window will show you which stream you are receiving.  This window updates every
ten seconds.  You can tell which games are available in HD with the HD 
indicator in the status bar.  Streams available in HD will show up as [HD]
in the indicator.  A stream that is not available in HD will show up as [--]
in the status bar.

+ Home/Away Video Streams (Yes)

To toggle between home and away streams, use the 's' key.  The stream 
preference will show up in the status bar as either [HOME] or [AWAY].  This
can also be overridden with the video_follow configuration file option.  
Specifying a team in video_follow means, "I don't care if the team is home 
or away, I always want that team's stream."  Video_follow is always observed
over the stream selection toggle.  Also, toggling the stream will update the
HD indicator.  Some fans really want to see a game in HD no matter which
broadcast team is covering it.  I would rather not listen to Hawk and Stone
no matter what quality the other team's stream may be. ;-)

+ Live Game DVR

This is not very well supported at this time.  The streams are seekable however
Mplayer is still kinda rough about supporting MLB.TV's streams.  Sometimes
the seek works, and sometimes it freezes Mplayer.  Use at your own risk.

Mlbviewer runs in two modes for 2009 season.  NexDef and non-NexDef mode.  
The default is NexDef and this is indicated with [NEXD] in the status bar
for the speed indicator.  You can turn off NexDef mode using the 'n' toggle
key.  In this case, the [NEXD] indicator will change to [800K] or [600K]
depending on your speed setting from last year (if you have speed=400, you
will actually see [600K] for your speed setting.)

+ Jump To Innings (Not yet - but planned)

+ Qualtiy Bars / Disable Auto-Adjust Quality (Not yet - but planned)

+ Live Game Highlights (Not yet - maybe planned?)

+ Live Game Radio Option (No, not planned - synchronization issue)

+ Player Tracker (No, not planned)

+ Live Game PiP (No, not planned)

+ Multi-Game Viewing Options (No/Maybe, might be possible with multiple
                              mlbviewer instances but not a planned feature)

BOOKMARKS

Do you remember what day Bonds hit 756?  Do you remember what day Griffey hit
600?  Do you remember what day the Angels no-hit the Dodgers and lost?  Now
you don't have to.  Simply highlight a game, press 'm' to mark it, and give it
a title.  The video, audio, and condensed game (if available) will be added
to your bookmarks file in $HOME/.mlb/bookmarks.pf.  To view and select streams
from your bookmarks, press the 'b' key.  To delete a bookmark, press 'x' or 
Backspace and confirm the deletion.  You should refresh your bookmarks view 
after you've deleted a bookmark by pressing 'b' again.  If bookmarks list is 
bigger than the window size, a --More-- dialog will appear at the bottom.  You 
can use the Spacebar to move to the next page of bookmarks.  If there are no
more bookmarks to view, an --End-- dialog will appear.

You can edit the title of an existing bookmark by pressing 'm' on the 
highlighted bookmark in the Bookmarks screen.

This is a new feature bound to have bugs.  Please submit bug reports either
to the LinuxQuestions.org thread or to the Sourceforge discussion forums.


A WORD ON DEBUGGING

By default, basic status messages are written to the log file in ~/.mlb/log.

mlbviewer is written with stability in mind.  Sometimes this stability hides 
errors that might be useful for the development team to figure out what's really
going on.  The debug state is not meant for normal operation.  In fact, with
debugging enabled, the audio or video URL will be retrieved, but the player 
process won't be started.  Debugging also disables most of the exception 
handling code.  In other words, debugging allows errors to drop through like a 
lead ball and produce Tracebacks.  Finally, debugging also produces verbose
network logging in the log file by dumping the raw web page and cookie content.
Please use debugging only if you suspect mlbviewer is covering up an error.

MLBGAMEID TEST TOOL

Every stream (audio or video including top plays) has a stream ID, a six digit
number, associated with it.  Every request to play a stream will output that 
six digit stream ID to the log file (regardless of the debug setting.)  If 
you want to test stream retrieval outside of mlbviewer (e.g. the error flies 
by the screen too quickly before returning to the listings screen), you can use
the mlbgameid.py script included in the test directory.  To use it, just call
that script with the stream ID as the argument.  To find a stream ID for a 
particular stream, select it first in mlbviewer (Enter or 'a') and then 
check the log file for a line like this:

Querying enterworkflow.do for { 'gameid' : 2008/04/30/kcamlb-texmlb-1, 'streamid' : 661986, 'streamtype' : video}

The stream ID for this video is 661986.  You can then call mlbgameid like this:

python test/mlbgameid.py 661986

mlbgameid will produce a lot of output very much like debugging except it will 
also execute your player command as specified in your configuration file.  The 
output of mlbgameid is NOT written to the log file.

MLBLISTINGS

Mlblistings.py is a test application that uses the MLBviewer library (which
is why it's not located in the test directory) and prints the listings for
a given day in a predictable "awk-able" format.  It is meant primarily for
finding the event-id of a particular game which can be used with the test 
tools described in the next section.

Mlblistings.py supports the startdate=mm/dd/yy command-line option.

Sample output:

$ mlblistings.py

The first line can be ignored or excluded with grep -v.

The fields for the remaining lines are:

1:Status Code (one of the following):
        "I" : "Status: In Progress",
        "W" : "Status: Not Yet Available",
        "F" : "Status: Final",
        "CG": "Status: Final (Condensed Game Available)",
        "P" : "Status: Not Yet Available",
        "S" : "Status: Suspended",
        "D" : "Status: Delayed",
        "IP": "Status: Pregame",
        "PO": "Status: Postponed",
        "GO": "Status: Game Over - stream not yet available",
        "NB": "Status: National Blackout",
        "LB": "Status: Local Blackout"

2:Game Time: Translated using time_offset option in ~/.mlb/config, if present

3:Gameid: These game id's are always of the format:
          year/month/day/awayteam-hometeam-sequence
          The sequence number is almost always 1 unless there is a doubleheader
          that day.

4:Event ID: This ID is necessary for the test tools described in the next
            section.

The event ID's can be used with the test scripts in the test directory.

The times are already in a format the 'at' command can accept so it is 
possible to schedule a game to play automatically using the at command.  See
the at(1) man page for more details on the at command.

The mlblistings.py script uses the $HOME/.mlb/config file wherever relevant,
and also accepts the startdate=m/d/yy command-line option for looking at 
listings in the future (or the past.)

Mlblistings.py can also be used as an example for developing your own 
application using the MLBviewer python library.

TEST TOOLS:

soapevent.py - a non-NexDef based tool for dumping a stream using rtmpdump
               requires an event-id argument.  Use mlblistings.py to find
               the event-id.

nexdef.py    - Same as soapevent.py except uses NexDef rather than rtmpdump

stdout.py    - Same as soapevent.py except it pipes rtmpdump output to 
               stdout and plays the resulting stream with mplayer (same as 
               mlbviewer)

These test tools produce a lot more debug output than mlbviewer and are used
primarily for testing network or media location errors.  

ADDITIONAL HELP

mlbviewer was born out of discussion in a forum on LinuxQuestions.org.  Some
very valuable discussions, concerns, feature requests, and most importantly 
bug reports were shared in this forum to make mlbviewer the robust and 
fairly stable application that it is today.  If you have any questions, 
concerns, feature requests, or bug reports, you can post to this thread:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/fedora-35/mlb.tv-in-linux-432479/

You can also find lots of tips and tricks in there and some very helpful users
who have probably encountered any issues you might have with mlbviewer or 
supporting applications.

If you want to lavish praise on us, we'll be happy to receive it there too.

SVN

mlbviewer has an svn repository on sourceforge.  You can checkout the latest
development code at any time with the following command:

svn co https://mlbviewer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlbviewer/trunk mlbviewer

You will need to install the subversion package if you don't have the svn 
command.  

Svn revisions are not official releases but they have the most recent bug
fixes and new features being tested.  It is through the efforts of those 
who want to test svn code that the development team gains confidence in 
any new code.  Please post any comments about svn revisions to the Linux
Questions forum above.  

When reporting bugs, please state the svn revision you are using.  This can be 
found with the 'svn info' command:

matthew@tango:~/mlbtv/svn/mlbviewer$ svn info
