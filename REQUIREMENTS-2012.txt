REQUIREMENTS FOR MLBVIEWER 2012 SEASON

FOR 2011 USERS:

If you used mlbviewer in 2011, not much has changed (yet.)

1. Download mlbhls (if you plan to use nexdef), build it, install it.

svn co https://mlbtv-hls-nexdef.googlecode.com/svn/branches/experimental mlbhls
cd mlbhls
make
sudo cp mlbhls /usr/bin

2. If you were using speed=800 in $HOME/.mlb/config, change that to 1200. The
800 stream may not be supported in 2012.

Other than that, you shouldn't have to do anything different for 2012.

NEW USERS:

To get going for the 2012 season, you will need the following packages:

OPTIONAL (but very helpful, especially for Linux beginners!):

Setuptools - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

This will help you download and install the required python packages

REQUIRED:

PyXML - http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/download.html

setuptools users: You can install these with the following commands (as root):

$ easy_install pyxml

Please read on for further requirements depending on whether you are an MLB.TV
Premium or MLB.TV Basic subscriber.

PREMIUM USERS

You will need mlbhls (see above) to access the higher bitrates.

NON-PREMIUM USERS (and Gameday Audio subscribers)

You will need rtmpdump version 1.7 or greater.

rtmpdump - http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/

[PROBABLY OBSOLETE] ALL USERS - VERY IMPORTANT

NOTE: In the past, you needed to build mplayer from the latest source to pick
up bug fixes made specifically for MLB streams.  However, it seems most recent
distributions and updated binaries have these fixes by now.  This section is 
here in case you run into problems with the video stream not being recognized 
at all.  If you have any other problems playing the video stream, this is also
an option available to you.

HISTORICAL (You can probably ignore this section)

You will need to re-compile MPlayer from source.  MPlayer requires a bug fix
to play MLB.TV streams smoothly.  This fix is only a couple of weeks old and 
far too new for any distribution's version of MPlayer to have it.

QUICK INSTRUCTIONS FOR GETTING AND BUILDING THE LATEST MPLAYER

Step 1: Verify you have subversion by typing "svn":

$ svn
Type 'svn help' for usage.
$

If you don't have subversion, you can download it from your distribution's
package management system (e.g. apt-get install subversion if you're using 
Ubuntu or Debian), or you can get it here:

http://subversion.tigris.org/

Step 2: Download the latest MPlayer source via svn:

$ svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk mplayer

Step 3: Run the configure script with, at a minimum, the following options:

$ cd mplayer
$ sh configure --enable-dynamic-plugins --prefix=/usr

It's very important you use --prefix=/usr as you want to install this new 
version of mplayer over your pre-distributed package.

Step 4: Run 'make'

$ make

Step 5: (as root), run 'make install'

$ make install

Also, you can post any support questions either to the Sourceforge forum at:

https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=224512

Or the Linux Questions thread here:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/fedora-35/mlb.tv-in-linux-432479/

No, you don't have to read all 200+ pages.  Just skip to the last page
and post question to the end of the thread.  There are several helpful
testers who have been with this project since the start.
