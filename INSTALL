Installation
------------

For local use:
     python mlbviewer.py from this directory.

For system install:
    python setup.py install

Note: Because MLB.TV has changed their service dramatically over the years, 
mlbviewer no longer attempts backwards compatibility.  If it is desired to 
play a previous year's games, please ask in the LQ forum (see README file) to
find out what the last stable release was for that season and instructions
on how to check it out from SVN.

For help, wait for the listings to load and press the 'h' key.

For more information, including configuration file settings, read the README.
